      body: >
        User slugs are different! Sometimes we do want to search by username
        (without the leading `user-`) - which requires a fullTextSearch index.

        If there isn't a registed listener for an EventEmitter "error" event, an

        exception will be raised and the nodeJS process will exit: see
        https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events

        This change adds a listener for the "error" event, and creates a log

        message to prevent the process from crashing.


        Fixes https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/5842

    - subject: Remove fullTextSearch index on user slug
      hash: 6afc2f4eca1f9825f4fdbc52d085713d17c38562
      body: >
        This index was added recently to facilitate searching for users by slug
        in a full text search query. But this isn't very sensible as it requires
        the user to include the `user-` prefix in the search term - which they
        will never (want to) do! So I'm removing the fullTextSearch index and
        the CreateView lens will manually search for the user by slug using a
        regex search.
